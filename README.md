# Equalizer
This is a simple app developed in java that provides a graphical view of some quadratic equations and trigonometric functions. To run the app, do the followings-

1. Run the file 'Quad.java'.
2. Write 'ax^3+bx^2+cx=d' for quadratic equation or 'c*sin^d(ax)+b' for trigonometric function of sine in the text field denoted by f(x).
3. For other trigonometric functions (i.e. cos, sec, cosec, tan, cot), write your desired function instead of 'sin'.
4. Press 'OK'.
5. Enter unit per division of the graph. Press 'OK'.
6. Adjust the value of a, b, c, d according to your equation.
7. Enjoy the graphical view of your equation.
